# S3A
This is an official PyTorch implementation of S3A method proposed in [S3A: A Self-Supervised Saliency Analysis Framework for Hyperspectral Image](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10976650). 

## Usage
Train the network on the Indian Pines dataset:
```
python main_IP.py
```

Train the network on the Pavia University dataset:
```
python main_PU.py
```

Train the network on the Salinas dataset:
```
python main_SA.py
```

## Results
### IP dataset
<center>

### PU dataset
</center>
